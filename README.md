# zw-responsive-grid

Responsive HTML grid with a bit of css and almost none vanilla JS. No Jquery.

<p>A grid with a certain amount of columns can take up considerable space on mobile device screens. Thinking about this problem, I decided to create a solution where you can hide columns that are not so important, due to a better user experience.</p>

<p>Responsive grid solutions, such as the solution documented in W3 Schools, where the responsiveness of a table is given by a horizontal scroll implies several usability problems.</p>

<p>manipulating the display of elements in a table is the best option, but we fall into the initial problem of this article: From a certain number of columns, the space occupied can be crucial for a good user experience.</p>

<p>To work around this problem, the solution proposed here, in this document, foresees the identification of the primary key of a row in the table, and the possibility of expanding the columns that are not so important, initially hidden, when the user deems it necessary to display these columns.</p>
